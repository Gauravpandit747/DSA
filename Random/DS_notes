Types of Data Structures :
    1. Linerar
    2. Non Linear

1. Linear:
    1. Arrays
    2. Linked Lists
    3. Stacks
    4. Queues 
    5. Hashing 

2. Non - Linear:
    1. Tree
    2. Graph

1. Arrays :
    Arrays are by default homogenious in nature, that means they can store only a value of only single Data type in them.
    In order to make them heterogenious we use a concept called as refertial Arrays.

    instead of using a regular call by value we use call by refrence, i.e instead of storing the values in continous assigned 
    memory locations we store the address of new data in that memory location which is of int by default.

    Example of referential arrays is Lists in Python 

    Disadvantages of Referntial Arrays :
    1) a Lill slower than the arrays in C
    2) Requires extra memory 


    Dynamic Array: 
        Internally it is a Static array only.
        Whenever a user requests to add a new element to a static array & the length of the static array is full.
        A new array static array is created twice the length of previous static array and the older contents of prev. static 
        aray are copied into new staic array, this process keeps on repeating as the static array keeps on filling.

        Eg of Dynamic array is Python List
